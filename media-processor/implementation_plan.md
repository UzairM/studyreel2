# Improved Implementation Plan for StudyReel

This document provides a comprehensive implementation plan for StudyReel, a software solution designed to monitor and analyze student activity in real-time on Mac and Windows platforms. Using video inputs (screen and webcam feeds with audio), the system detects events and tracks progress with high accuracy (at least 95% for all events, 99% for XP-related) and low latency (under 5 seconds, ideally under 1 second). The plan leverages OSS tools and a modular architecture to ensure scalability, adaptability, and performance, making it suitable for execution by an LLM agentic software team.

## Overview
StudyReel enhances student engagement and learning outcomes by providing real-time monitoring and feedback. It detects activities, behaviors, and progress within learning apps, categorizing time as active or inactive and identifying anti-patterns (e.g., idling, cheating) and speed bumps (e.g., rushing). The solution is designed to be generic, scalable to millions of users, and validated against a test harness with pre-annotated videos.

---

## Key Requirements
- **Real-time Event Detection**: Identify app usage, time spent, question answering, anti-patterns, and speed bumps.
- **High Accuracy**: Minimum 95% for general events, 99% for XP-related events.
- **Low Latency**: Event detection and feedback within 5 seconds (ideally under 1 second).
- **Scalability**: Support thousands to millions of concurrent users.
- **Generality**: Adapt to new learning apps with minimal changes.
- **Validation**: Use pre-annotated videos to confirm accuracy.

---

## System Architecture
The system is organized into modular layers:
1. **Data Collection**: Captures screen, webcam, and audio feeds.
2. **Data Processing**: Extracts features using OCR, computer vision, and audio analysis.
3. **Event Detection**: Employs a multi-tier LLM system and rules for event identification.
4. **Progress Tracking**: Monitors XP and lesson completion.
5. **Real-time Feedback**: Posts events to an event bus and displays popups.
6. **Scalability and Generality**: Ensures adaptability and large-scale deployment.
7. **Testing and Validation**: Validates accuracy and performance.

## Event Types to Detect

### Activity Status
- **ACTIVE**: Student is actively engaged with the learning app
- **INACTIVE**: Student is not engaged with the learning app

### App Usage Events
- **APP_OPENED**: Student opened a learning app
- **APP_CLOSED**: Student closed a learning app
- **APP_SWITCHED**: Student switched to a different app
- **LESSON_STARTED**: Student started a new lesson
- **LESSON_COMPLETED**: Student completed a lesson
- **QUESTION_ANSWERED**: Student answered a question
- **XP_GAINED**: Student gained experience points

### Anti-Patterns
- **IDLING**: Student is not interacting with the app for an extended period
- **CHEATING**: Student is using unauthorized resources
- **DISTRACTED**: Student is distracted by other applications or activities
- **MULTI_TASKING**: Student is working on multiple things simultaneously

### Speed Bumps
- **RUSHING**: Student is moving through content too quickly
- **STUCK**: Student is stuck on a particular question or concept
- **CONFUSED**: Student appears confused based on facial expressions or behavior
- **FRUSTRATED**: Student shows signs of frustration

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Collection Layer
**Objective**: Efficiently capture real-time screen, webcam, and audio feeds.

**Tools**:
- **Screen Capture**: `pyautogui` (cross-platform), `mss` (Windows), `screencapture` (Mac).
- **Webcam Capture**: `opencv-python`.
- **Audio Capture**: `pyaudio` or `sounddevice`.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Configure screen capture at 1-2 seconds intervals to balance accuracy and performance.
- Set webcam capture at 5-10 FPS for efficient processing.
- Enable continuous audio capture with real-time buffering.
- Optimize capture methods for Windows and Mac compatibility.

---

### 2. Data Processing Layer
**Objective**: Extract actionable features from raw data.

**Tools**:
- **OCR**: `Tesseract` for text extraction.
- **Computer Vision**: `OpenCV` and `OpenPose` for webcam analysis.
- **Audio Processing**: `SpeechRecognition` for speech-to-text, `librosa` for feature extraction.

**Implementation Steps**:
- **Screen Processing**:
  - Preprocess images (e.g., enhance contrast) for better OCR results.
  - Extract app names, course details, and text using Tesseract.
- **Webcam Processing**:
  - Detect student presence and actions (e.g., eating) with OpenCV.
  - Fine-tune lightweight models (e.g., MobileNet) for speed.
- **Audio Processing**:
  - Transcribe speech with SpeechRecognition.
  - Analyze audio features (e.g., tone, keywords) with librosa to detect socializing.

---

### 3. Event Detection Layer
**Objective**: Identify events using a multi-tier LLM system and rules.

**Tools**:
- **LLMs**: `transformers` (Hugging Face) for models like BERT or GPT-2.
- **Rule-based Logic**: For deterministic events.

**Implementation Steps**:
- **LLM Design**:
  - Use a single, fine-tuned LLM for text-based event detection (e.g., question answering).
  - Reserve multi-tier approach for complex events if justified by performance gains.
- **Event Types**:
  - Rules for simple events (e.g., IDLING after 5 minutes of inactivity).
  - LLMs for complex events (e.g., cheating, rushing).
- **Optimization**:
  - Process inputs asynchronously or in batches.
  - Use distilled models for faster inference.

---

### 4. Progress Tracking Layer
**Objective**: Accurately track XP and lesson completion.

**Tools**:
- **API Integration**: For apps with accessible data.
- **Screen Analysis**: OCR and image recognition for others.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Integrate with learning app APIs where available.
- Use OCR to detect progress indicators (e.g., checkmarks, scores).
- Implement student feedback to confirm completions and refine detection.

---

### 5. Real-time Feedback Layer
**Objective**: Deliver immediate feedback via an event bus and popups.

**Tools**:
- **Event Bus**: `Apache Kafka` or `RabbitMQ`.
- **Notifications**: `win32api` (Windows), `osascript` (Mac).

**Implementation Steps**:
- Set up an event bus to stream detected events.
- Develop a desktop app to listen to the bus and display subtle popups.
- Ensure end-to-end latency stays under 5 seconds.

---

### 6. Scalability and Generality
**Objective**: Support new apps and large user bases.

**Tools**:
- **Plug-in Architecture**: For app-specific logic.
- **Distributed Systems**: Docker, cloud services.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Design a modular system with plug-ins for new apps.
- Deploy on cloud infrastructure with load balancing.
- Use transfer learning to adapt LLMs to new contexts.

---

### 7. Testing and Validation
**Objective**: Ensure accuracy and performance meet requirements.

**Tools**:
- **Pre-annotated Videos**: For validation.
- **Stress Testing**: Simulate high concurrency.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Process annotated videos and compare outputs to annotations.
- Test edge cases (e.g., low light, noisy audio).
- Simulate thousands of users to verify scalability.

---

## Additional Considerations
- **Privacy**: Encrypt data and comply with GDPR/CCPA.
- **Performance**: Optimize for low CPU/memory usage.
- **User Experience**: Offer pause options and adjustable settings.
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform behavior across platforms.
